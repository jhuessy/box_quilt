I like making colorful geometric patterns as an arts and crafts project.  

This is a field of boxes (hexagons made to look like cubes).

Each box has a red face, a green face and a blue face.

Each row slowly shifts from red to green to blue.

There is a pattern of lighter and darker boxes to create a honeycomb effect.
